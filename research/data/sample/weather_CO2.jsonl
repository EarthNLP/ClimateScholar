This depth zone and time period of reprieve can be periodically interrupted by strong northwesterly winds that drive short-lived (~1 week) episodes of high-pCO2, low-pH, and low- conditions throughout the region. Interannual variability in summertime conditions was evident and linked to reduced northwesterly winds and increased stratification. Anthropogenic CO2 in NSS surface water was estimated using data from 2017 combined with the global atmospheric CO2 forcing for the period 1765 to 2100, and projected a mean value of 49 \u00b1 5 \u00b5mol kg-1 for 2018.

OCO-2 launched on 2 July 2014, and during the first 2 years of its operation, a major El Ni\u00f1o occurred: the 2015\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o, which was one of the strongest events ever recorded. El Ni\u00f1o and its cold counterpart La Ni\u00f1a (collectively known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation or ENSO) are the dominant modes of tropical climate variability. ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean but spurs a variety of anomalous weather patterns around the globe. Not surprisingly, it also leaves an imprint on the global carbon cycle. Understanding the magnitude and phasing of the ENSO-CO2 relationship has important implications for improving the predictability of carbon-climate feedbacks. The high-density observations from NASA\u2019s OCO-2 mission, coupled with surface ocean CO2 measurements from NOAA buoys, have provided us with a unique data set to track the atmospheric CO2 concentrations and unravel the timing of the response of the ocean and the terrestrial carbon cycle during the 2015\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o. RATIONALE During strong El Ni\u00f1o events, there is an overall increase in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This increase is predominantly due to the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to El Ni\u00f1o\u2013induced changes in weather patterns. But along with the terrestrial component, the tropical Pacific Ocean also plays an important role. Typically, the tropical Pacific Ocean is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to equatorial upwelling that brings CO2-rich water from the interior ocean to the surface. During El Ni\u00f1o, this equatorial upwelling is suppressed in the eastern and the central Pacific Ocean, reducing the supply of CO2 to the surface. If CO2 fluxes were to remain constant elsewhere, this reduction in ocean-to-atmosphere CO2 fluxes should contribute to a slowdown in the growth of atmospheric CO2. This hypothesis cannot be verified, however, without large-scale CO2 observations over the tropical Pacific Ocean. RESULTS OCO-2 observations confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean played an early and important role in the response of atmospheric CO2 concentrations to the 2015\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o. By analyzing trends in the time series of atmospheric CO2, we see clear evidence of an initial decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the tropical Pacific Ocean, specifically during the early stages of the El Ni\u00f1o event (March through July 2015). Atmospheric CO2 concentration anomalies suggest a flux reduction of 26 to 54% that is validated by the NOAA Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring CO2 data. Both the OCO-2 and TAO data further show that the reduction in ocean-to-atmosphere fluxes is spatially variable and has strong gradients across the tropical Pacific Ocean. During the later stages of the El Ni\u00f1o (August 2015 and later), the OCO-2 observations register a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We attribute this increase to the response from the terrestrial component of the carbon cycle\u2014a combination of reduction in biospheric uptake of CO2 over pan-tropical regions and an enhancement in biomass burning emissions over Southeast Asia and Indonesia. The net impact of the 2015\u20132016 El Ni\u00f1o event on the global carbon cycle is an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which would likely be larger if it were not for the reduction in outgassing from the ocean. CONCLUSION The strong El Ni\u00f1o event of 2015\u20132016 provided us with an opportunity to study how the global carbon cycle responds to a change in the physical climate system. Space-based observations of atmospheric CO2, such as from OCO-2, allow us to observe and monitor the temporal sequence of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013induced changes in CO2 concentrations. Disentangling the timing of the ocean and terrestrial responses is the first step toward interpreting their relative contribution to the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate, and thereby understanding the sensitivity of the carbon cycle to climate forcing on interannual to decadal time scales. NASA\u2019s carbon sleuth tracks the influence of El Ni\u00f1o on atmospheric CO2. The tropical Pacific Ocean, the center of action during an El Ni\u00f1o event, is shown in cross section. Warm ocean surface temperatures are shown in red, cooler waters in blue. The Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region, which scientists use to study the El Ni\u00f1o, is denoted by yellow dashed lines. As a result of OCO-2\u2019s global coverage and 16-day repeat cycle, it flies over the entire region every few days, keeping tabs on the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Spaceborne observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 are used to characterize the response of tropical atmospheric CO2 concentrations to the strong El Ni\u00f1o event of 2015\u20132016. Although correlations between the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation are well known, the magnitude of the correlation and the timing of the responses of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycle remain poorly constrained in space and time. We used space-based CO2 observations to confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean does play an early and important role in modulating the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during El Ni\u00f1o events\u2014a phenomenon inferred but not previously observed because of insufficient high-density, broad-scale CO2 observations over the tropics.", "authors": [{"authorId": "40275377", "name": "A.

Megacities are major sources of anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions. The spatial extents of these large urban systems cover areas of 10\u202f000\u202fkm2 or more with complex topography and changing landscapes. We present a high-resolution land\u2013atmosphere modelling system for urban CO2 emissions over the Los Angeles (LA) megacity area. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Chem model was coupled to a very high-resolution FFCO2 emission product, Hestia-LA, to simulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations across the LA megacity at spatial resolutions as fine as \u2009\u223c\u2009\u202f1\u202fkm. We evaluated multiple WRF configurations, selecting one that minimized errors in wind speed, wind direction, and boundary layer height as evaluated by its performance against meteorological data collected during the CalNex-LA campaign (May\u2013June\u00a02010). Our results show no significant difference between moderate-resolution (4\u202fkm) and high-resolution (1.3\u202fkm) simulations when evaluated against surface meteorological data, but the high-resolution configurations better resolved planetary boundary layer heights and vertical gradients in the horizontal mean winds. We coupled our WRF configuration with the Vulcan\u00a02.2 (10\u202fkm resolution) and Hestia-LA (1.3\u202fkm resolution) fossil fuel CO2 emission products to evaluate the impact of the spatial resolution of the CO2 emission products and the meteorological transport model on the representation of spatiotemporal variability in simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that high spatial resolution in the fossil fuel CO2 emissions is more important than in the atmospheric model to capture CO2 concentration variability across the LA megacity. Finally, we present a novel approach that employs simultaneous correlations of the simulated atmospheric CO2 fields to qualitatively evaluate the greenhouse gas measurement network over the LA megacity. Spatial correlations in the atmospheric CO2 fields reflect the coverage of individual measurement sites when a statistically significant number of sites observe emissions from a specific source or location. We conclude that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the LA megacity are composed of multiple fine-scale plumes rather than a single homogenous urban dome. Furthermore, we conclude that FFCO2 emissions monitoring in the LA megacity requires FFCO2 emissions modelling with \u2009\u223c\u2009\u202f1\u202fkm resolution because coarser-resolution emissions modelling tends to overestimate the observational constraints on the emissions estimates.", "authors": [{"authorId": "46524172", "name": "S.

Geological data of numerical model are acquired from core samples. Simulations show that minerals interaction plays an important role on sealing efficiency of caprock. Overall, porosity and permeability of caprock decrease with CO2 sequestration, which indicates that main mineral reaction in caprock is precipitation, and caprock sealing efficiency is enhanced.", "authors": [{"authorId": "47655573", "name": "B.

Satellite tracking and collision avoidance planning require accurate density forecasts during these events. Over the past several years, failed density forecasts have been tied to the onset of rapid and significant cooling due to production of NO and its associated radiative cooling via emission of infrared radiation at 5.3 \u03bcm. These results have been diagnosed, after the fact, through analyses of measurements of infrared cooling made by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument now in orbit over 16 years on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite. Radiative cooling rates for NO and CO2 have been further shown to be directly correlated with composition and exospheric temperature changes during geomagnetic storms. These results strongly suggest that a network of smallsats observing the infrared radiative cooling of the thermosphere could serve as space weather sentinels. These sentinels would observe and provide radiative cooling rate data in real time to generate nowcasts of density and aerodynamic drag on space vehicles. Currently, radiative cooling is not directly considered in operational space weather forecast models. In addition, recent research has shown that different geomagnetic storm types generate substantially different infrared radiative response, and hence, substantially different thermospheric density response. The ability to identify these storms, and to measure and predict the Earth's response to them, should enable substantial improvement in thermospheric density forecasts.", "authors": [{"authorId": "3418283", "name": "M.

These include the radiative and thermodynamical processes that determine the surface temperature and vertical structure of the atmosphere, the fluid dynamics of its atmospheric motions, and the key cycles of mineral dust and volatile transport. In many ways, the climate of Mars is as complicated and diverse as that of the Earth, with complex nonlinear feedbacks that affect its response to variations in external forcing. Recent work has shown that the martian climate is anything but static, but is almost certainly in a continual state of transient response to slowly varying insolation associated with cyclic variations in its orbit and rotation.

Our study quantifies C fluxes in two hard\u2010water, human constructed reservoirs (Ohio, USA) of contrasting watershed land use (agriculture vs. forest) using high\u2010resolution mass balance budgets.

Using our C fluxes and statewide watershed land use, we determined the regional importance of Ohio reservoirs in OC burial and CO2 emissions.

The use of eddy covariance (EC) CO2 flux measurements in data assimilation and other applications requires an estimate of the random uncertainty. In previous studies, the (classical) two-tower approach has yielded robust uncertainty estimates, but care must be taken to meet the often competing requirements of statistical independence (non-overlapping footprints) and ecosystem homogeneity when choosing an appropriate tower distance. The role of the tower distance was investigated with help of a roving station separated between 8 m and 34 km from a permanent EC grassland station. Random uncertainty was estimated for five separation distances with the classical two-tower approach and an extended approach which removed systematic differences of CO2 fluxes measured at two EC towers. This analysis was made for a data set where (i) only similar weather conditions at the two sites were included, and (ii) an unfiltered one. The extended approach, applied to weather-filtered data for separation distances of 95 and 173 m gave uncertainty estimates in best correspondence with an independent reference method. The introduced correction for systematic flux differences considerably reduced the overestimation of the two-tower based uncertainty of net CO2 flux measurements and decreased the sensitivity of results to tower distance. We therefore conclude that corrections for systematic flux differences (e.g., caused by different environmental conditions at both EC towers) can help to apply the two-tower approach to more site pairs with less ideal conditions.", "authors": [{"authorId": "51199486", "name": "H.

CO2: 35.0\u00b11.1\u2003g\u2003m\u22122\u2003yr\u22121) was more than twice as high as that in the dry year (amb. CO2: 11.6\u00b11.7\u2003g\u2003m\u22122, elev. CO2: 13.3\u00b13.4\u2003g\u2003m\u22122), and contained a greater proportion of Lycium pallidum and a lower proportion of Larrea tridentata than litter produced in the dry year. Decomposition, viewed across all treatments, decreased with increasing C:N ratios, decreased with increasing proportions of Larrea tridentata and increased with increasing proportions of Lycium pallidum and Lycium andersonii. Because litter C:N did not vary by litter production year, and CO2 did not alter decomposition or litter species/tissue composition, it is likely that the impact of year\u2010to\u2010year variation in precipitation on the proportion of key plant species in the litter may be the most important way in which litter decomposition will be modulated in the Mojave Desert under future rising atmospheric CO2.", "authors": [{"authorId": "88698169", "name": "Heather Weatherly"}, {"authorId": "39980677", "name": "S.

Winds favorable for offshore transport along with high freshwater discharge contributed to a widespread MARS plume, which was statistically different from those normally occurring in spring. A strong relationship was observed between the location of this widespread plume and a reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide () and elevated satellite\u2010derived chlorophyll a. Furthermore, in the plume was reduced by 6.3 Pa (62 ppm) in March 2010 in contrast to a reduction of only 2.4 Pa in April 2009, thus exhibiting a greater CO2 uptake capacity in March 2010. This wide plume also covered at least twice the area and was a stronger CO2 sink by a factor of five when compared to more typical plume conditions in April 2009.

The mixing height (MH) is a crucial parameter in commonly used transport models that proportionally affects air concentrations of trace gases with sources/sinks near the ground and on diurnal scales. Past synthetic data experiments indicated the possibility to improve tracer transport by minimizing errors of simulated MHs. In this paper we evaluate a method to constrain the Lagrangian particle dispersion model STILT (Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport) with MH diagnosed from radiosonde profiles using a bulk Richardson method. The same method was used to obtain hourly MHs for the period September/October 2009 from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which covers the European continent at 10 km horizontal resolution. Kriging with external drift (KED) was applied to estimate optimized MHs from observed and modelled MHs, which were used as input for STILT to assess the impact on CO2 transport. Special care has been taken to account for uncertainty in MH retrieval in this estimation process. MHs and CO2 concentrations were compared to vertical profiles from aircraft in situ data. We put an emphasis on testing the consistency of estimated MHs to observed vertical mixing of CO2. Modelled CO2 was also compared with continuous measurements made at Cabauw and Heidelberg stations. WRF MHs were significantly biased by ~10\u201320% during day and ~40\u201360% during night. Optimized MHs reduced this bias to ~5% with additional slight improvements in random errors. The KED MHs were generally more consistent with observed CO2 mixing. The use of optimized MHs had in general a favourable impact on CO2 transport, with bias reductions of 5\u201345% (day) and 60\u201390% (night). This indicates that a large part of the found CO2 model\u2013data mismatch was indeed due to MH errors. Other causes for CO2 mismatch are discussed.

Spatial correlations in residuals from TM5\u2010CT2009 are higher than WRF\u2010CT2009 perhaps due to TM5's coarse horizontal resolution and shallow vertical mixing.

A HEO enables quasi\u2010geostationary observations of Earth's northern high latitudes, which are not observed from a geostationary orbit. The orbit and observing characteristics for the HEO mission are based on the Weather, Climate and Air quality (WCA) concept proposed for the Polar Communications and Weather (PCW) mission, while those for the LEO mission are based on the Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). Two WCA instrument configurations were investigated. Adopting the Optimal configuration yielded an observation data set that gave annual Arctic and boreal regional terrestrial biospheric CO2 flux uncertainties an average of 30% lower than those from GOSAT, while a smaller instrument configuration resulted in uncertainties averaging 20% lower than those from GOSAT. For either WCA instrument configuration, much greater reductions in uncertainty occur for spring, summer, and autumn than for winter, with Optimal flux uncertainties for June\u2013August nearly 50% lower than from GOSAT.

However, there is no consensus on CO2 emissions as affected by soil management practices. Deeper understanding of soil CO2 fluxes and drivers under different management practices are needed. The investigation of net CO2 exchange rate as dependent variable and drivers (soil water and temperature, air temperature) as affected by soil type (loam and sandy loam), tillage (conservation and no-tillage) and fertilization are presented. Soil management practices and weather conditions affected the CO2 flux through effects on soil water and temperature regime. Mean net CO2 exchange rate on sandy loam was 8% higher than on loam. No-tillage, as a moisture-conserving tool, could be an appropriate tool for CO2 emissions mitigation in any weather conditions on sandy loam; however, the advantage of no-tillage on loam was negligible. Mineral NPK fertilizers promoted significantly higher net CO2 exchange rate in both soils, but suppressed it by 15% on sandy loam during a normal year. Effect of soil water content on net CO2 exchange rate was direct in all tillage and fertilization treatments in both loam and sandy loam, whereas this effect was positive only in dry and normal weather conditions. In wet weather conditions, the direct effect of soil water content on net CO2 exchange rate was negative. Soil and air temperature acted indirectly on net CO2 exchange rate. The increase in temperature markedly suppressed the positive direct impact of soil water content on net CO2 exchange rate in dry weather conditions, but did not reduce the direct effect of soil water content in normal weather conditions. In a wet year the negative indirect effect of increased temperature enhanced the negative direct impact of soil water surplus on net CO2 exchange rate.", "authors": [{"authorId": "15593329", "name": "D.

CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) has received tremendous attention due to its significant role in intensifying global warming. Considering the lack of a timely review on the state-of-the-art progress of promising CCU techniques, developing an appropriate and prompt summary of such advanced techniques with a comprehensive understanding is necessary. Thus, it is imperative to provide a timely review, given the fast growth of sophisticated CO2 capture and utilization materials and their implementation. In this work, we critically summarized and comprehensively reviewed the characteristics and performance of both liquid and solid CO2 adsorbents with possible schemes for the improvement of their CO2 capture ability and advances in CO2 utilization. Their industrial applications in pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture as well as utilization were systematically discussed and compared. With our great effort, this review would be of significant importance for academic researchers for obtaining an overall understanding of the current developments and future trends of CCU. This work is bound to benefit researchers in fields relating to CCU and facilitate the progress of significant breakthroughs in both fundamental research and commercial applications to deliver perspective views for future scientific and industrial advances in CCU.", "authors": [{"authorId": "8360959", "name": "Wanlin Gao"}, {"authorId": "4547798", "name": "S.
