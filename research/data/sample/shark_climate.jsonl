Here, we used long-term data from natural predator\u2212prey interactions between white sharks Carcharodon carcharias and Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus in False Bay, South Africa, paired with environmental monitoring to examine potential relationships between temperature variability and shark predation rates on seals. Based on generalized linear modelling of a dataset of 941 shark attacks on seals collected over 15 years (1999\u22122013) during the austral winter (May\u2212September) season, we found water temperature was included as a significant predictor of daily and monthly variability in predation rates. However, the signal of temporal variability over the season emerged as a more predominant predictor. Moreover, inter-annual variability in predation rate appeared linked to other environmental factors (wind, water visibility, and the occurrence of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events) rather than water temperature. These data suggest that water temperatures on an intra-annual scale might contribute to predation patterns in white sharks either directly or indirectly (e.g. due to associated changes in prey availability), but do not implicate water temperature as a primary driver in this scenario, or at an interannual scale. It is possible that (1) the metabolic demand of white sharks may be modulated against temperature variability by their partially endothermic nature, and (2) the predation patterns of white sharks on seals are the result of a complex interplay between ambient physical conditions and broader oceanographic, biological, and ecological factors.", "authors": [{"authorId": "23624918", "name": "R.

Although these cartilaginous fish have evolved to fill many ecological niches across a wide range of habitats, they have limited capability to rapidly adapt to human-induced changes in their environments. Contrary to global warming, ocean acidification was not considered as a direct climate-related threat to sharks. Here we show, for the first time, that an early ontogenetic acclimation process of a tropical shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) to the projected scenarios of ocean acidification (\u0394pH = 0.5) and warming (+4\u00b0C; 30\u00b0C) for 2100 elicited significant impairments on juvenile shark condition and survival. The mortality of shark embryos at the present-day thermal scenarios was 0% both at normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions. Yet routine metabolic rates (RMRs) were significantly affected by temperature, pH and embryonic stage. Immediately after hatching, the Fulton condition of juvenile bamboo sharks was significantly different in individuals that experienced future warming and hypercapnia; 30 days after hatching, survival rapidly declined in individuals experiencing both ocean warming and acidification (up to 44%). The RMR of juvenile sharks was also significantly affected by temperature and pH. The impact of low pH on ventilation rates was significant only under the higher thermal scenario. This study highlights the need of experimental-based risk assessments of sharks to climate change. In other words, it is critical to directly assess risk and vulnerability of sharks to ocean acidification and warming, and such effort can ultimately help managers and policy-makers to take proactive measures targeting most endangered species.", "authors": [{"authorId": "144341470", "name": "R.

Predicted future distribution for this species was modelled for the forecast strengthening East Australian Current. Bull sharks were mostly harvested in small to larger estuaries, with average depth and rainfall responsible for contrasting patterns for each of the fisheries. There was an increase in the occurrence of bull sharks over the last decade, particularly among coastal setline fisheries, associated with seasonal availability of thermal gradients >22\u00b0C and both westward and southward coastal currents stronger than 0.15 and 0.60 m s-1, respectively, during the austral summer. Our model predicts a 3 mo increase in the availability of favourable water temperatures along the entire coast of NSW for bull sharks by 2030. This coastline provides a uniquely favourable topography for range expansion in the face of a southerly shift of warmer waters, and habitat is unlikely to be a limiting factor for bull sharks in the future.

Worldwide, there are six distinct populations with some haplotype sharing. These populations are probably connected by a stepping-stone dispersal of a small number of migrants per generation from the Indo-Pacific towards the Atlantic. Modelling suggests that S. zygaena diverged into two lineages around 6.96 million years ago which have been isolated in glacial refuges in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans; and after deglaciation, a population expansion probably permitted secondary contact. Conservation plans to establish differentiated management units should be adopted in each of the identified populations. Among these, the Eastern Central Atlantic and West Indo-Pacific are the most important areas for the species considering the historical migration routes that act as a bridge connecting the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans while the Gulf of Guinea connects the Atlantic populations. Still, further studies are required to know if these populations are also linked with nursery areas for the species.

We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space.

Despite this, it is only within the last decade that substantial research effort has been directed at these species. Research effort has increased in conjunction with the realisation that reef shark populations have experienced significant declines throughout their distribution. However, trends in declines have been coupled with reports of high abundance in some areas providing confusion about what healthy reef shark populations should look like. Given that coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and productive habitats, but also are one of the most threatened by climate change due to the effects of rising temperature and declining pH, there is a need to understand reef sharks to better predict consequences for their populations. Studies of reef sharks also have the potential to provide insights into the functioning of their populations and ecosystems more broadly because of the spatially constrained nature of their distributions, and high water visibility in most locations. These aspects make studying reef shark populations integral to understanding coral reef ecosystem dynamics and resilience to pressures.

At Monkey Mia, Shark Bay, Australia, up to five adult female Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) visit a 100 m stretch of beach daily to receive fish handouts. In 2011, a severe marine heatwave (MHW) devastated seagrass and fish populations in Shark Bay. Offspring survival declined precipitously among seagrass specialists (dolphins that forage disproportionately in seagrass habitat). As all provisioned dolphins at the site are seagrass specialists, we examined how provisioned and non-provisioned seagrass specialists responded to the MHW. Using 27 years of data we compare habitat use, home range size, calf mortality, and predation risk between provisioned and non-provisioned females and their offspring before and after the MHW. Our results show that provisioned females have extremely small home ranges compared to non-provisioned females, a pattern attributable to their efforts to remain near the site of fish handouts. However, weaned offspring (juveniles) born to provisioned females who are not provisioned themselves also had much smaller home ranges, suggesting a persistent maternal effect on their behavior. After the MHW, adult females increased their use of seagrass habitats, but not their home range size. Provisioned females had significantly lower calf mortality than non-provisioned females, a pattern most evident pre-MHW, and, in the first 5 years after the MHW (peri-MHW, 2011\u20132015), calf mortality did not significantly increase for either group. However, the ecosystem did not recover, and post-MHW (2016\u20132020), calf mortality was substantially higher, regardless of provisioning status. With few survivors, the impact of the MHW on juvenile mortality post-weaning is not known. However, over three decades, juvenile mortality among offspring of provisioned vs. non-provisioned females did not statistically differ. Thus, the survival benefits accrued to calves in the provisioned group likely cease after weaning. Finally, although shark attack rates on seagrass specialists did not change over time, elevated predation on calves cannot be ruled out as a cause of death post-MHW. We discuss our results as they relate to anthropogenic influences on dolphin behavioral plasticity and responses to extreme climate events.", "authors": [{"authorId": "152253702", "name": "J.

We summarise the extinction risk of the sharks and rays endemic to coastal, shelf, and slope waters of the SWIO (Namibia to Kenya, including SWIO islands). Thirteen of 70 species (19%) are threatened: one is Critically Endangered, five are Endangered, and seven are Vulnerable. A further seven (10%) are Near Threatened, 33 (47.1%) are Least Concern, and 17 (24.2%) are Data Deficient. While the primary threat is overfishing, there are the first signs that climate change is contributing to elevated extinction risk through habitat reduction and inshore distributional shifts. By backcasting their status, few species were threatened in 1980, but this changed soon after the emergence of targeted shark and ray fisheries. South Africa has the highest national conservation responsibility, followed by Mozambique and Madagascar. Yet, while fisheries management and enforcement have improved in South Africa over recent decades, drastic improvements are urgently needed elsewhere. To avoid extinction and ensure robust populations and future food security, there is an urgent need for the strict protection of Critically Endangered and Endangered species and sustainable management of all species, underpinned by species-level data collection and bycatch reduction.", "authors": [{"authorId": "1753239731", "name": "Riley A.

Sharks are high trophic level predators that play a key role in the regulation of ecosystem structure and health. Because many sharks are already threatened, it is especially important to understand the impact of climate change on these species. We used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to predict changes in future (2050\u20132099) relative to current (1956\u20132005) habitat suitability for pelagic sharks based on an ensemble of climate models and emission scenarios. Our predictive models indicate that future sea temperatures are likely to shift the location of suitable shark habitat within the Australian EEZ. On average, suitable habitat is predicted to decrease within the EEZ for requiem and increase for mackerel sharks, however, the direction and severity of change was highly influenced by the choice of climate model.

The result is the unintentional take of shortfin mako and blue sharks primarily due to their spatial overlap with swordfish near the surface at night. Although these species overlap spatially their movements are driven by both physical and ecological processes. These behavioral responses, if they are predictable, can be used to separate species to reduce bycatch, inform stock assessments, and predict shifts cause by human induced climate change. This paper will focus on understanding the oxygen limits for three mako and three blue sharks double tagged with Pop-off Satellite archival tags and Satellite linked radio transmitter tags in the SCB California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation survey grid. The sharks were linked to CalCOFI stations to better understand differences in oxygen preferences. Neither species spent a large amount of time in low oxygen waters. The results suggest that blue sharks make more dives into low oxygen environments and remain there for longer periods of time than shortfin mako. Neither species exploited the deeper low oxygen waters to the extent that swordfish do.

Being ectothermic organisms, sharks of the family Carcharhinidae could be highly susceptible to the effects of climate change. These sharks are of great ecological importance, which is reflected in their role in the integrity of coastal and oceanic ecosystems as top predators that act to maintain the stability of the food chain, as well as providing economic value through fishing, consumption, and ecotourism. Currently, their populations are threatened by fishing pressure and anthropogenic activities, including meeting the demand for shark fins. Despite the ecological and economical importance of carcharhinid sharks, knowledge regarding how they are impacted by climate change remains scarce. Ecological niche modeling is a tool that allows analysis of future potential distributions under different climate change scenarios and could contribute to future planning activities and improved conservation outcomes for sharks. We generated models in Maxent in order to predict the potential geographic distribution of 25 carcharhinid sharks that inhabit Mexican waters, projecting this onto future climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) to calculate the potential losses and gains in their distribution areas by the year 2050. The greatest shifts in suitable areas were observed for the sharks Triaenodon obesus (gained area) and Carcharhinus porosus (lost area). Overall, under all four RCP future scenarios, six species presented gains in suitable area and 19 species presented losses. The greatest loss of suitable area for carcharhinid sharks was found with RCP8.5; however, under this high-emissions global warming scenario, seven species actually showed an increase in distribution area. Our results therefore indicate that climate change could reduce suitable areas for most of the species by 2050. Assessment of the distribution of shark species under climate change is urgently required in order to prioritize conservation efforts toward the most vulnerable species and to ensure the natural function of marine ecosystems, thus maintaining the important ecosystem services they provide to human society.", "authors": [{"authorId": "1403768204", "name": "Pedro Luis D\u00edaz-Carballido"}, {"authorId": "1438398467", "name": "Gabriela Mendoza-Gonz\u00e1lez"}, {"authorId": "1405101681", "name": "C.

The causes of such diversity decline remain elusive and are especially difficult to understand over a long-time scale and global distribution. Relying on unprecedented species-level fossil datasets spanning the last 140 million years, we investigated the causes of the wax and wane of mackerel sharks (Lamniformes), including the great white shark. We find that both temperature and competition with some ecologically similar members of their sister group, the ground sharks, played a substantial role in the lamniform demise. Our results provide quantitative evidence that the Court Jester and Red Queen can jointly drive the radiation and extinction of entire lineages. Understanding heterogeneity in species richness between closely related clades is a key research question in ecology and evolutionary biology. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to interpret such diversity contrasts across the tree of life, with most studies focusing on speciation rates to explain clades\u2019 evolutionary radiations, while often neglecting extinction rates. Here we study a notorious biological model as exemplified by the sister relationships between mackerel sharks (Lamniformes, 15 extant species) and ground sharks (Carcharhiniformes, \u223c290 extant species). Using a comprehensive fossil dataset, we found that the diversity dynamics of lamniforms waxed and waned following repeated cycles of radiation phases and declining phases. Radiation phases peaked up to 3 times the current diversity in the early Late Cretaceous. In the last 20 million years, the group declined to its present-day diversity. Along with a higher extinction risk for young species, we further show that this declining pattern is likely attributed to a combination of abiotic and biotic factors, with a cooling-driven extinction (negative correlation between temperature and extinction) and clade competition with some ground sharks. Competition from multiple clades successively drove the demise and replacement of mackerel sharks due to a failure to originate facing the rise of ground sharks, particularly since the Eocene. These effects came from ecologically similar carcharhiniform species inhibiting diversification of medium- and large-sized lamniforms. These results imply that the interplay between abiotic and biotic drivers had a substantial role in extinction and speciation, respectively, which determines the sequential rise and decline of marine apex predators.", "authors": [{"authorId": "5108438", "name": "F.

Correlation between silky indices and the PDO was found to differ by region and size category. The highest correlations by shark size category were for small ( 150\u00a0cm TL). These results are suggestive of changes in the small and medium silky indices being driven by movement of juvenile silky sharks across the Pacific as the eastern edge of the Indo\u2010Pacific Warm Pool shifts location with ENSO events.

New products were sought after for export by Danish merchants and the peasant farming community responded by increasing the production of the relevant products. The whole period from 1800 to 1850 saw a continuing increase in the exports of sheep products and shark liver oil, which had a common origin in peasant farming production. This period contrasts with the eighteenth century when there was no corresponding growth in exports. The level of exports in the eighteenth century remained overall much the same except during periods of dearth, when it fell. Traditionally the beginning of the modernisation of Icelandic society is dated to around 1880\u20131910. However, it could be argued that increasing exports of sheep products and shark liver oil after 1800 saw a clear break with the eighteenth-century pattern and that the period should be taken into consideration as being the origin period of economic modernisation in Iceland.

This single thermal perturbation led to several mortality events and recruitment impairment of commercially important species including Australia\u2019s single highest producing blue swimmer crab (Portunus armatus) fishery in Shark Bay. Monthly catch landings dramatically declined from 166 t in April 2011 to <10 t by December 2011 promoting its closure in 2012 to allow for stock recovery. Examination of stock-environment relationships critical to the recruitment of blue swimmer crabs living towards their thermal maxima, showed juvenile P. armatus to be most susceptible to heat stress when mean water temperatures between December and January were greater than 24\u00b0C, and detrimental when they exceed 26\u00b0C as was the case during the 2011 MHW when SSTs reached 29\u00b0C. Partial recovery of the crab stock 18 months after the MHW was strongly associated with mean summer temperatures returning below 24\u00b0C. Together with a change in management to a quota system, the fishery returned to full recovery status in 2018 with sustainable catch levels of up to 550 t. Long term fishery productivity is now at high risk from climate change impacts with shifts in winter water temperatures being cooler by 2\u00b0C and occurring earlier by few months inside the Bay. This cooling trend appears to be impacting the spawning period with the timing of peak recruitment also occurring earlier, shifting from February to November. The impacts of the 2011 MHW highlighted the risk to stock sustainability through external drivers such as climate change that was previously poorly understood. Therefore, responding to climate change is now about managing risks to achieve a balance between fisheries sustainability and economic viability. Increased stock monitoring now provides biomass measures 12 months prior to the fishing season, a form of stock forecasting that stakeholders can utilise to better manage their fishing business and minimise economic loss, while a flexible harvest strategy now responds to recruitment variation and climate extremes.", "authors": [{"authorId": "21283250", "name": "Arani Chandrapavan"}, {"authorId": "35914162", "name": "N.

Four indicator species had consistently higher abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution. The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP zoning.

Any number of ecosystem components or indicators could be used to exemplify this dilemma, but here we point to the salmon shark (Lamna ditropis, Lamnidae) as an example of a species that can potentially mediate considerable ecosystem change due to its high trophic level, but for which some basic information is lacking despite attracting some interesting research and widespread rumours and anecdotal evidence of increased abundance. Increases in the abundance of sharks such as salmon sharks in this region during the 1990s, if true, may help explain other observed changes such as declines in ocean survival rates of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp., Salmonidae) in the region and declines in some wild salmon stocks. Mechanisms that could cause salmon shark increases in Alaskan coastal waters include: (i) increases in sea temperature since the 1970s allowing distributional shifts of this species and changes in the abundance or distribution of their prey; (ii) the 1992 banning of high seas drift gillnets; and (iii) indirect fisheries effects such as competitive release of salmon sharks in the North Pacific transition region and towards the more southern geographic extent of their annual migration as the result of fishery-related reductions in blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) and other pelagic predators.

Understanding what influences ecosystem recovery is particularly important in seagrass ecosystems because of their functional roles, vulnerability, and divergent recovery strategies. Seagrass cover was monitored for 3 yr following a large, heatwaveassociated mortality event in Shark Bay, Australia. Although the ecosystem\u2019s historically dominant foundational seagrass, Amphibolis antarctica, is capable of rapid disturbance recovery, this did not occur, likely because of the failure of mechanisms which have driven rapid recovery in other systems (persistence of rhizome beds, sexual reproduction among neighboring beds). Instead, a tropical early successional seagrass, Halodule uninervis, became more common, increasing diversity. These changes in the structure of the Shark Bay seagrass ecosystem, and reduction of biomass and structural complexity, will have important implications for ecosystem services and community dynamics and indicates that this ecosystem is highly vulnerable to future disturbances. More generally, our work suggests that seagrass ecosystems typified by a mix of early and late successional species may be particularly likely to exhibit a mismatch between recovery of cover per se and recovery of function following disturbance.

We propose that the negative impact was magnified by the synergistic interactions both stressors had on the carbon balance of the plant. The elevated temperatures increased plant demand for carbon, which could not be met through photosynthesis due to turbid floodwaters reducing light availability, resulting in the plant having a negative carbon balance.

The relative percentage of contribution of some environmental variables (depth, sea surface temperature, salinity and primary production) and the potential impact of climate change on species habitat by the end of the century under the A2 scenario (scenario with average concentrations of carbon dioxide of 856 ppm by 2100) were also evaluated. Results showed that by-catch species can be correctly modelled using observed occurrence records and few environmental variables with SDM. Results from projected maps showed that the equatorial band and some coastal upwelling regions were the most suitable areas for both by-catch species in the three oceans in concordance with the main fishing grounds. Sea surface temperature was the most important environmental variable which contributed to explain the habitat distribution of the two species in the three oceans in general. Under climate change scenarios, the largest change in present habitat suitability is observed in the Atlantic Ocean (around 16% of the present habitat suitability area of Carcharhinus falciformis and Canthidermis maculata, respectively) whereas the change is less in the Pacific (around 10% and 8%) and Indian Oceans (around 3% and 2 %).

This approach has been taken because vulnerability assessments provide a useful framework for organising and integrating different types of information. Vulnerability frameworks have been used to assess a variety of fisheries related risks including the risks to bycatch species such as sea snakes and turtles (Griffiths et al., 2006, Milton, 2001) and sharks and rays (Stobutzki et al., 2002); the economic risks climate change poses to fisheries (Fletcher, 2005); sustainability and risks of targeted fishing for sharks and rays (Salini et al., 2007, Walker, 2005a), and a wide range of other fisheries (see Hobday et al., 2007 for review). Australian fisheries have used vulnerability frameworks which compare a species\u2019 susceptibility to the fishery against its productivity to describe sustainability (Gribble et al., 2005, Hobday et al., 2007, Salini et al., 2007, Stobutzki et al., 2001). Vulnerability frameworks are also used in assessing the vulnerability of species and systems to climate change (Chin et al., 2010, Fussel & Klein, 2006, Johnson & Marshall, 2007). \n \nIn spite of the diversity of approaches, most vulnerability frameworks used to describe human-environment systems contain common conceptual elements (Adger, 2006): the exposure of the assessment entity (e.g. a species) to risk factors; the sensitivity of the assessment entity to the risks identified; and the adaptive capacity of the species to cope with the risk factors (Adger, 2006). These three components (or 'dimensions') and their interactions describe the characteristics of the entity being assessed, the relationships between these characteristics and external factors, and integrate this information to estimate relative risk (Polsky et al., 2007) (see Fig 1.1). In this project, a vulnerability framework is used to identify and contextualize information about the biology, life history and spatial ecology of the blacktip reef shark, to describe the species' exposure to pressures from fishing and habitat degradation, and to describe the consequences of these interactions for the conservation and management of the species (Fig 1.1). \n \nBased on the previously identified knowledge gaps and the implications of these data for the conservation and management of the species, this project is has four discrete aims, each of which is designed to explore critical aspects of the blacktip reef shark's biology, ecology and conservation. \n \nAim 1 (chapter 2): quantify the catch of blacktip reef sharks in the GBR net fishery and describe trends in catch locations and fate of captured sharks. This will document the interactions between the blacktip reef shark and the largest shark fishery operating in the GBRWHA. This information will describe the exposure of the species to fishing pressure which is currently believed to be the most significant pressure facing sharks and rays in the GBRWHA, and provide preliminary information about the blacktip reef shark's occurrence amongst the various habitats of the GBRWHA. \n \nAim 2 (chapter 3): describe the population characteristics of blacktip reef sharks in the GBRWHA lagoon. The project will describe the structure of blacktip reef shark populations in the coastal and inshore regions of the GBRWHA and identify patterns in sex composition and sexual maturity of individuals in a population. The timing and location of critical life history events (e.g. mating, parturition) will also be identified, and population movements (immigration, emigration, dispersal, site fidelity) will be documents. Collectively, these data will help to determine the exposure and sensitivity of the blacktip reef shark to anthropogenic factors such as fishing and habitat degradation. \n \nAim 3 (chapter 4): describe the biology and life history of the blacktip reef shark. The project will provide the first description of the age and growth parameters of the species, and will also provide regionally relevant and validated life history and reproductive parameters such as reproductive periodicity, litter size and size at maturity data. These data will help to assess the species sensitivity to pressures such as fishing and habitat loss. \n \nAim 4 (chapters 5 and 6): describe the movement and habitat use patterns of the blacktip reef shark in the GBRWHA lagoon. The project will document the species' movement and habitat use patterns at a variety of temporal scales to identify critical habitats and movement corridors. The behavior of the blacktip reef shark will also be examined, and the coverage provided by marine park zoning will also be explored. These data will provide information on the species' exposure to anthropogenic pressures, and sensitivity and adaptive capacity to these pressures. \nThe penultimate chapter of the thesis (chapter 7) will draw these elements together to discuss the significance of these data in advancing scientific understanding of the biology and ecology of the study species and the interactions between coastal habitats and sharks and rays, and through the vulnerability framework, provide a comprehensive account of the vulnerability of this species to fishing and habitat loss.", "authors": [{"authorId": "49705498", "name": "A.

To date, metrics of thermal stress within marine systems have focussed on coral communities, and less is known about measuring stress relevant to other primary producers, such as seagrasses. An extreme MHW occurred across the Western Australian coastline in the austral summer of 2010\u20132011, exposing marine communities to summer seawater temperatures 2\u20135\u00b0C warmer than average. Using a combination of satellite imagery and in situ assessments, we provide detailed maps of seagrass coverage across the entire Shark Bay World Heritage Area (ca. 13,000 km2) before (2002 and 2010) and after the MHW (2014 and 2016). Our temporal analysis of these maps documents the single largest loss in dense seagrass extent globally (1,310 km2) following an acute disturbance. Total change in seagrass extent was spatially heterogeneous, with the most extensive declines occurring in the Western Gulf, Wooramel Bank and Faure Sill. Spatial variation in seagrass loss was best explained by a model that included an interaction between two heat stress metrics, the most substantial loss occurring when degree heating weeks (DHWm) was \u226510 and the number of days exposed to extreme sea surface temperature during the MHW (DaysOver) was \u226594. Ground truthing at 622 points indicated that change in seagrass cover was predominantly due to loss of Amphibolis antarctica rather than Posidonia australis, the other prominent seagrass at Shark Bay. As seawater temperatures continue to rise and the incidence of MHWs increase globally, this work will provide a basis for identifying areas of meadow degradation, or stability and recovery, and potential areas of resilience.", "authors": [{"authorId": "3399191", "name": "S.

The IRACC merges a traditional climate change vulnerability framework with approaches from fisheries ecological risk assessments. This semi\u2010quantitative assessment accommodates uncertainty and can be applied at different spatial and temporal scales to identify exposure factors, at\u2010risk species and their key biological and ecological attributes, critical habitats a`nd ecological processes, and major knowledge gaps. Consequently, the IRACC can provide a foundation upon which to develop climate change response strategies. Here, we describe the assessment process, demonstrate its application to GBR shark and ray species, and explore the issues affecting their vulnerability to climate change. The assessment indicates that for the GBR, freshwater/estuarine and reef associated sharks and rays are most vulnerable to climate change, and that vulnerability is driven by case\u2010specific interactions of multiple factors and species attributes. Changes in temperature, freshwater input and ocean circulation will have the most widespread effects on these species. Although relatively few GBR sharks and rays were assessed as highly vulnerable, their vulnerability increases when synergies with other factors are considered. This is especially true for freshwater/estuarine and coastal/inshore sharks and rays. Reducing the impacts of climate change on the GBR's sharks and rays requires a range of approaches including mitigating climate change and addressing habitat degradation and sustainability issues. Species\u2010specific conservation actions may be required for higher risk species (e.g. the freshwater whipray, porcupine ray, speartooth shark and sawfishes) including reducing mortality, preserving coastal catchments and estuarine habitats, and addressing fisheries sustainability. The assessment identified many knowledge gaps concerning GBR habitats and processes, and highlights the need for improved understanding of the biology and ecology of the sharks and rays of the GBR.", "authors": [{"authorId": "49705498", "name": "A.
