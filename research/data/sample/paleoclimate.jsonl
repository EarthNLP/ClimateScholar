Here, we present a review of the added value of the regional climate modeling approach within the scope of paleoclimate research and discuss the current major challenges and perspectives. Two time periods serve as an example: the Holocene, including the Last Millennium, and the Last Glacial Maximum. Reviewing the existing literature reveals the benefits of regional paleo climate modeling, particularly over areas with complex terrain. However, this depends largely on the variable of interest, as the added value of regional modeling arises from a more realistic representation of physical processes and climate feedbacks compared to global climate models, and this affects different climate variables in various ways. In particular, hydrological processes have been shown to be better represented in regional models, and they can deliver more realistic meteorological data to drive ice sheet and glacier modeling. Thus, regional climate models provide a clear benefit to answer fundamental paleoclimate research questions and may be key to advance a meaningful joint interpretation of climate model and proxy data.", "authors": [{"authorId": "2091923820", "name": "P.

This is especially true in the Big Data age, where analyzing large data volumes critically hinges on the data being standardized. Accordingly, the lack of community\u2010sanctioned data standards in paleoclimatology has largely precluded the benefits of Big Data advances in the field. Building upon recent efforts to standardize the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate data sets, particularly for synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working groups. Participants in this process identified important properties across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive\u2010specific properties and distinguished reporting standards for new versus legacy data sets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying paleoclimate data sets. Since such goals are at odds with present practices, we discuss a transparent path toward implementing or revising these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down approaches.", "authors": [{"authorId": "26901841", "name": "D.

This is crucial to, among others, correctly assess the amount of solar energy received at a location at the moment of sediment deposition. The paleolatitude of an arbitrary location can in principle be reconstructed from tectonic plate reconstructions that (1) restore the relative motions between plates based on (marine) magnetic anomalies, and (2) reconstruct all plates relative to the spin axis using a paleomagnetic reference frame based on a global apparent polar wander path. Whereas many studies do employ high-quality relative plate reconstructions, the necessity of using a paleomagnetic reference frame for climate studies rather than a mantle reference frame appears under-appreciated. In this paper, we briefly summarize the theory of plate tectonic reconstructions and their reference frames tailored towards applications of paleoclimate reconstruction, and show that using a mantle reference frame, which defines plate positions relative to the mantle, instead of a paleomagnetic reference frame may introduce errors in paleolatitude of more than 15\u00b0 (>1500 km). This is because mantle reference frames cannot constrain, or are specifically corrected for the effects of true polar wander. We used the latest, state-of-the-art plate reconstructions to build a global plate circuit, and developed an online, user-friendly paleolatitude calculator for the last 200 million years by placing this plate circuit in three widely used global apparent polar wander paths. As a novelty, this calculator adds error bars to paleolatitude estimates that can be incorporated in climate modeling. The calculator is available at www.paleolatitude.org. We illustrate the use of the paleolatitude calculator by showing how an apparent wide spread in Eocene sea surface temperatures of southern high latitudes may be in part explained by a much wider paleolatitudinal distribution of sites than previously assumed.", "authors": [{"authorId": "3433506", "name": "D.

The main conclusion to be inferred from this\nEBM is that the climate system may possess multiple equilibrium states, both warm and\nfrozen, which coexist mathematically. While the actual climate can exist in only one of\nthese states at any given time, the EBM suggests that climate can undergo transitions\nbetween the states via mathematical saddle-node bifurcations.

The March 2015 precipitation event offered the first modern opportunity to evaluate a major regional precipitation event relative to those hypothetical paleoclimate scenarios. It was the first opportunity to determine the 18O and 2H composition of a major precipitation event that might eventually be preserved in geological materials. The driver for the March 2015 event was a synoptic-scale weather system, a cutoff cold upper-level low system that traversed the Pacific Ocean at a time of unusually warm temperatures of Pacific surface water. Ground-based precipitation data, stable isotopes in precipitation and river samples, NCEP/NCAR reanalysis atmospheric data and air mass tracking are utilized to connect the Earth surface processes to atmospheric conditions. The \u03b418O and \u03b42H of the precipitation and ephemeral rivers were significantly heavier than the rain, snow and ephemeral rivers fed by more frequent but less voluminous precipitation events registered prior to March 2015. Consistent with the atmospheric analyses, the rain isotopic compositions are typical of a water vapor whose source was at more equatorial latitudes of the Pacific and which moved southward. The late March 2015 system was an unforeseen scenario even for El Ni\u00f1o Pacific ocean conditions. Furthermore, the late summer season warmth led to greater potential for erosion and sediment transport than typical of more common moderate precipitation scenarios which usually include widely distributed snow. A comparison of the March 2015 scenario to the spatial distribution of wetter paleoclimate intervals leads to the hypothesis that the March 2015 scenario likely better fits some parts of the paleoclimate record of the continental interior hyperarid Atacama Desert than do the eastern or southwestern moisture source paleoclimate scenarios deduced previously.", "authors": [{"authorId": "144253765", "name": "T.

Paleoclimate proxies are being used in conjunction with ice sheet modeling\nexperiments to determine how the Greenland ice sheet responded to past\nchanges, particularly during the last deglaciation. Although these\ncomparisons have been a critical component in our understanding of the\nGreenland ice sheet sensitivity to past warming, they often rely on modeling\nexperiments that favor minimizing computational expense over increased model\nphysics. Over Paleoclimate timescales, simulating the thermal structure of\nthe ice sheet has large implications on the modeled ice viscosity, which can\nfeedback onto the basal sliding and ice flow. To accurately capture the\nthermal field, models often require a high number of vertical layers. This is\nnot the case for the stress balance computation, however, where a high\nvertical resolution is not necessary. Consequently, since stress balance and\nthermal equations are generally performed on the same mesh, more time is\nspent on the stress balance computation than is otherwise necessary. For\nthese reasons, running a higher-order ice sheet model (e.g., Blatter-Pattyn)\nover timescales equivalent to the paleoclimate record has not been possible\nwithout incurring a large computational expense. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose a method that can be implemented within ice sheet models, whereby the\nvertical interpolation along the z axis relies on higher-order polynomials,\nrather than the traditional linear interpolation. This method is tested\nwithin the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) using quadratic and cubic finite\nelements for the vertical interpolation on an idealized case and a realistic\nGreenland configuration. A transient experiment for the ice thickness\nevolution of a single-dome ice sheet demonstrates improved accuracy using the\nhigher-order vertical interpolation compared to models using the linear\nvertical interpolation, despite having fewer degrees of freedom. This method\nis also shown to improve a model's ability to capture sharp thermal gradients\nin an ice sheet particularly close to the bed, when compared to models using\na linear vertical interpolation. This is corroborated in a thermal\nsteady-state simulation of the Greenland ice sheet using a higher-order\nmodel. In general, we find that using a higher-order vertical interpolation\ndecreases the need for a high number of vertical layers, while dramatically\nreducing model runtime for transient simulations. Results indicate that when\nusing a higher-order vertical interpolation, runtimes for a transient ice\nsheet relaxation are upwards of 5 to 7 times faster than using a model which\nhas a linear vertical interpolation, and this thus requires a higher number of\nvertical layers to achieve a similar result in simulated ice volume, basal\ntemperature, and ice divide thickness. The findings suggest that this method\nwill allow higher-order models to be used in studies investigating ice sheet\nbehavior over paleoclimate timescales at a fraction of the computational cost\nthan would otherwise be needed for a model using a linear vertical\ninterpolation.", "authors": [{"authorId": "103757849", "name": "J.

In one region of these isotope records, our previous calculations (See Garland et al. 2018) revealed an abrupt change in the complexity of the traces: specifically, in the amount of new information that appeared at every time step. We conjectured that this effect was due to noise introduced by an older laboratory instrument. In this paper, we validate that conjecture by reanalyzing a section of the ice core using a more advanced version of the laboratory instrument. The anomalous noise levels are absent from the permutation entropy traces of the new data.

Here, we focus on the uncertainties that result from the analysis of only a few replicate measurements to understand the extent to which unconstrained errors affect calibration relationships and paleoclimate reconstructions. We find that highly precise data can be routinely obtained with multiple replicate analyses, but this is not always done in many laboratories. For instance, using published estimates of external reproducibilities we find that typical clumped isotope measurements (three replicate analyses) have margins of error at the 95% confidence level (CL) that are too large for many applications. These errors, however, can be systematically reduced with more replicate measurements. Second, using a Monte Carlo\u2010type simulation we demonstrate that the degree of disagreement on published calibration slopes is about what we should expect considering the precision of \u039447 data, the number of samples and replicate analyses, and the temperature range covered in published calibrations. Finally, we show that the way errors are typically reported in clumped isotope data can be problematic and lead to the impression that data are more precise than warranted. We recommend that uncertainties in \u039447 data should no longer be reported as the standard error of a few replicate measurements. Instead, uncertainties should be reported as margins of error at a specified confidence level (e.g., 68% or 95% CL).

It is broadly assumed that this renders the resultant time series of terrestrial paleoclimatic variability noisy and incomplete. We evaluate this assumption using a model of oscillating climate and the precise topographic evolution of an experimental alluvial system. We find that geomorphic stochasticity can create aliasing in the time series and spurious climate signals, but these issues are eliminated when the period of climate oscillation is longer than a key time scale of internal dynamics in the geomorphic system. This emergent autogenic geomorphic behavior imparts regularity to deposition and represents a natural discretization interval of the continuous climate signal.

Obtaining reliable reconstructions of long-term atmospheric circulation changes in the North Atlantic region presents a persistent challenge to contemporary paleoclimate research, which has been addressed by a multitude of recent studies. In order to contribute a novel methodological aspect to this active field, we apply here evolving functional network analysis, a recently developed tool for studying temporal changes of the spatial co-variability structure of the Earth's climate system, to a set of Late Holocene paleoclimate proxy records covering the last two\u00a0millennia. The emerging patterns obtained by our analysis are related to long-term changes in the dominant mode of atmospheric circulation in the region, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). By comparing the time-dependent inter-regional linkage structures of the obtained functional paleoclimate network representations to a recent multi-centennial NAO reconstruction, we identify co-variability between southern Greenland, Svalbard, and Fennoscandia as being indicative of a positive NAO phase, while connections from Greenland and Fennoscandia to central Europe are more pronounced during negative NAO phases. By drawing upon this correspondence, we use some key parameters of the evolving network structure to obtain a qualitative reconstruction of the NAO long-term variability over the entire Common Era (last 2000\u00a0years) using a linear regression model trained upon the existing shorter reconstruction.", "authors": [{"authorId": "2065374113", "name": "J.

Disputed ages for the onset of hyperaridity range from the late Paleogene through the Pleistocene. A long-term paleoclimate record is recorded in a nonmarine basin whose fill is primarily alluvial strata. For this setting, the primary proxies for climate state are the mineralogical and chemical composition of soil, which varies across a precipitation gradient, and the landforms and deposits of alluvial fans. During the most recent \u223c15 million years, five climate-related landscape stages are resolved for the Pampa del Tamarugal sedimentary basin, with each successively younger stage inset lower in the local topography than its predecessor. The earliest landscape stage is expressed as a set of alluvial strata inherited from a time of arid or semi-arid climate, ca. 14\u201312 Ma. The younger four landscape stages generated a composite long-lasting exposure surface. Predominantly hyperarid conditions have persisted since ca. 12 \u00b1 1 Ma, during which four intervals of arid to semi-arid climate occurred. Each wet interval was short lived, a million years or less, whereas some of the hyperarid periods were lengthy, 1\u20135 m.y.

Paleopedology thus offers a great potential for elucidating high resolution, deep-time paleoclimate records. However, many fossil soils did not equilibrate with climate prior to burial and instead dominantly express physical and chemical features reflective of other soil forming factors. Current models that use elemental oxides for climate reconstruction bypass the issue of soil-climate equilibration by restricting datasets to narrow ranges of soil properties, soil-forming environments and mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Here we evaluate a data-driven paleosol-paleoclimate model (PPM1.0) that uses subsoil geochemistry to test the ability of soils from wide-ranging environments to predict MAP and MAT as a joint response with few initial assumptions. The PPM1.0 was developed using a combined partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a nonlinear spline on 685 mineral soil B horizons currently forming under MAP ranging from 130 to 6900 mm and MAT ranging from 0 to 27 \u00b0C. The PLSR results on 11 major and minor oxides show that four linear combinations of these oxides (Regressors 1-4), akin to classic oxide ratios, have potential for predicting climate. Regressor 1 correlates with increasing MAP and MAT through Fe oxidation, desilication, base loss and residual enrichment. Regressor 2 correlates with MAT through temperature-dependent dissolution of Na- and K-bearing minerals. Regressor 3 correlates with increasing MAP through decalcification and retention of Si. Regressor 4 correlates with increasing MAP through Mg retention in mafic-rich parent material. The nonlinear spline model fit on Regressors 1 to 4 results in a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSEMAP) of 228 mm and RMSEMAT of 2.46 \u00b0C. PPM1.0 model simulations result in Root Mean Squared Predictive Error (RMSPEMAP) of 512 mm and RMSPEMAT of 3.98 \u00b0C. The RMSE values are lower than some preexisting MAT models and show that subsoil weathering processes operating under a wide range of soil forming factors possess climate prediction potential, which agrees with the state-factor model of soil formation. The nonlinear, multivariate model space of PPM1.0 more accurately reflects the complex and nonlinear nature of many weathering processes as climate varies. This approach is still limited as it was built using data primarily from the conterminous USA and does not account for effects of diagenesis. Yet, because it is calibrated over a broader range of climatic variable space than previous work, it should have the widest array of potential applications. Furthermore, because it is not dependent on properties that may be poorly preserved in buried paleosols, the PPM1.0 model is preferable for reconstructing deep time climate transitions. In fact, previous studies may have grossly underestimated paleo-MAP for some paleosols.", "authors": [{"authorId": "4322697", "name": "G. Stinchcomb"}, {"authorId": "8137320", "name": "L.

It is hypothesized that originally upper-crustal, margin-transverse faults have evolved to through-going crustal features during the Quaternary, providing structurally controlled pathways for hydrothermal fluids.

Despite limited observational data, stable isotope tracers have been commonly used to constrain modern\u2010to\u2010ancient Andean atmospheric processes, as well as to reconstruct paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry histories. Here, we present isotopic compositions of precipitation (\u03b418Op and \u03b4Dp) from 11 micrometeorological stations located throughout the Bolivian Altiplano and along its eastern flank at ~21.5\u00b0S. We collected and isotopically analyzed 293 monthly bulk precipitation samples (August 2008 to April 2013). \u03b418Op values ranged from \u221228.0\u2030 to 9.6\u2030, with prominent seasonal cycles expressed at all stations. We observed a strong relationship between the \u03b418Op and elevation, though it varies widely in time and space. Constraints on air sourcing estimated from atmospheric back trajectory calculations indicate that continental\u2010scale climate dynamics control the interannual variability in \u03b418Op, with upwind precipitation anomalies having the largest effect. The impact of precipitation anomalies in distant air source regions to the central Andes is in turn modulated by the Bolivian High. The importance of the Bolivian High is most clearly observed on the southern Bolivian Altiplano. However, monthly variability among Altiplano stations can exceed 10\u2030 in \u03b418Op on the plateau and cannot be explained by elevation or source variability, indicating a nontrivial role for local scale effects on short timescales. The strong influence of atmospheric circulation on central Andean \u03b418Op requires that paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry studies consider the role of South American atmospheric paleocirculation in their interpretation of stable isotopic values as proxies.", "authors": [{"authorId": "48096291", "name": "R.

Through comparison with observations of the environmental impacts of these climate changes, or with climate reconstructions based on physical, chemical or biological records, PMIP also addresses the issue of how well state-of-the-art models simulate climate changes. Palaeoclimate states are radically different from those of the recent past documented by the instrumental record and thus provide an out-of-sample test of the models used for future climate projections and a way to assess whether they have the correct sensitivity to forcings and feedbacks. Five distinctly different periods have been selected as focus for the core palaeoclimate experiments that are designed to contribute to the objectives of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). This manuscript describes the motivation for the choice of these periods and the design of the numerical experiments, with a focus upon their novel features compared to the experiments performed in previous phases of PMIP and CMIP as well as the benefits of common analyses of the models across multiple climate states.

Of central importance to this success has been the development of astrochronologic testing methods for the evaluation of astronomical-climate influence on sedimentation. Most pre-Pleistocene astrochronologic testing methods fall into one of two categories: (1) those that test for expected amplitude or frequency modulation imposed by an astronomical signal or (2) those that test for bedding hierarchies (frequency ratios or bundling) that are predicted by the dominant astronomical periods. In this study, a statistical methodology for combining these complementary approaches is developed, which identifies the time scale that simultaneously optimizes eccentricity amplitude modulation of the precession band, and the concentration of power at precession (carrier) and eccentricity (modulator) frequencies. The technique is demonstrated to have high statistical power\u2014it is capable of identifying astronomical cycles when present\u2014under a wide range of conditions, and its application to synthetic models illuminates a range of potential pitfalls that are encountered when more conventional nonoptimization approaches are used. The method is also independent from the interpretation of power spectrum peak significance, resolving previous concerns regarding appropriate confidence level assessment and \u201cmultiple testing.\u201d As two case studies, the algorithm is applied to Miocene strata of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 926B, and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum-Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 interval at ODP Site 1262.

The inverse and forward approaches to paleoclimate data\u2013model comparison are applied, and sources of uncertainty are identified and discussed. In the first of two case studies, the climate model simulations are compared with multiproxy temperature reconstructions. Robust solar and volcanic signals are detected in Southern Hemisphere temperatures, with a possible volcanic signal detected in the Northern Hemisphere.

Typical environmental proxy measurements include speleothem growth rate and variations in elemental and isotope geochemistry. Commonly the assumption is made that speleothems grow continuously and at a constant rate throughout the year. However, seasonal variation of growth rate may be the rule in many caves. Here we apply observations of modern calcite growth and cave\u2010air CO2 concentrations and a model of factors controlling cave ventilation to construct a global model predicting where cave calcite growth may be seasonal. Previous models and measurements of calcite precipitation in caves demonstrate the retardation of speleothem growth by high cave\u2010air CO2. Elevated CO2 is commonly dissipated by ventilation driven by density differences between cave and surface air. Seasonal cycles in atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity commonly drive these density contrasts. Modeling these changes latitudinally and globally indicates a geographic control on seasonal cave ventilation and thus on a principal controlling factor of speleothem growth. The model predicts that given constant water, calcium, and CO2 inputs, speleothems from temperate to boreal continental regions commonly accumulate more calcite in the cool season and less or none in the warm season. These models predict that proxies from temperate to boreal speleothems may be seasonally biased due to seasonal ventilation, whereas tropical and maritime records should not.", "authors": [{"authorId": "83875317", "name": "E.

A further unresolved issue is the role of Milankovitch theory, in which the glacial/interglacial cycles are correlated with orbital variations. We perform tests for Granger causality in the context of a vector autoregression model.

Tests for oxygen isotope time-series replication and equilibrium", "abstract": "The use of aragonite stalagmites as paleoclimate proxies has become increasingly common because of their often exceptional uranium-series dating precision and fast growth rates, which allow near-annual climate resolution. However, aragonite is known to be susceptible to open-system behavior and may recrystallize to calcite under typical cave conditions. As a result, the fidelity of the oxygen isotopic variations preserved in aragonite stalagmites is not yet as firmly established as for calcite stalagmites, and few studies have investigated oxygen isotope replication and equilibrium with cave drip waters. I present new data and review findings from the literature that show that aragonite stalagmites may pass both the equilibrium and replication tests in some cases, but that other aragonites are clearly precipitated out of equilibrium with cave drip waters. As a case study, \u03b4 18 O data for three exceptionally well-dated stalagmites from Juxtlahuaca Cave, Mexico, are presented. Two of the stalagmites are aragonite, and the third was measured on a diagenetically calcitized aragonite stalagmite. These results show that the modern aragonite precipitates in apparent oxygen isotopic equilibrium with drip waters, and the two aragonite speleothems replicate strongly over the past 530 yr, thus confirming a common paleoclimate signal. Observations of \u03b4 18 O systematics in previously published aragonite stalagmite \u03b4 18 O records from China and Belize show that at least two samples clearly precipitated modern aragonite out of isotopic equilibrium with cave drip waters. Because the equilibrium test only applies to modern precipitation for which temperature and drip-water \u03b4 18 O values are known, both equilibrium and replication tests are required for confident interpretation of aragonite stalagmite \u03b4 18 O time series, and studies that fail or do not attempt such tests should be considered cautiously.", "authors": [{"authorId": "4513091", "name": "M.

Central Asia is located at the confluence of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems. It is thus likely to be highly susceptible to changes in the dynamics of those systems; however, little is still known about the regional paleoclimate history. Here we present carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of n-alkanoic acids from a late Holocene sediment core from Lake Karakuli (eastern Pamir, Xinjiang Province, China). Instrumental evidence and isotope-enabled climate model experiments with the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique Zoom model version 4 (LMDZ4) demonstrate that \u03b4 D values of precipitation in the region are influenced by both temperature and precipitation amount. We find that these parameters are inversely correlated on an annual scale, i.e., the climate has varied between relatively cool and wet and more warm and dry over the last 50 years. Since the isotopic signals of these changes are in the same direction and therefore additive, isotopes in precipitation are sensitive recorders of climatic changes in the region. Additionally, we infer that plants use year-round precipitation (including snowmelt), and thus leaf wax \u03b4 D values must also respond to shifts in the proportion of moisture derived from westerly storms during late winter and early spring. Downcore results give evidence for a gradual shift to cooler and wetter climates between 3.5 and 2.5 cal kyr BP, interrupted by a warm and dry episode between 3.0 and 2.7 kyr BP. Further cool and wet episodes occur between 1.9 and 1.5 and between 0.6 and 0.1 kyr BP, the latter coeval with the Little Ice Age. Warm and dry episodes from 2.5 to 1.9 and 1.5 to 0.6 kyr BP coincide with the Roman Warm Period and Medieval Climate Anomaly, respectively. Finally, we find a drying tend in recent decades. Regional comparisons lead us to infer that the strength and position of the westerlies, and wider northern hemispheric climate dynamics, control climatic shifts in arid Central Asia, leading to complex local responses.

However, the accurate estimation of hydrological risk is hampered by relatively short instrumental records in many parts of the world. Information derived from climate\u2010sensitive paleoclimate proxies provide an opportunity to resolve hydroclimatic variability, but many regions, such as Australia's Murray\u2010Darling Basin (MDB), currently lack the suitable in situ proxies necessary to do this. Here new MDB rainfall reconstructions are presented based on a novel method using paleoclimate rainfall proxies in the Australasian region spanning from 749 B.C.E. to 1980 C.E. Our results emphasize the need to develop additional reconstructions and, with the companion paper, demonstrate how this information can be used to benefit water resource management. This study shows that prior to the twentieth century, both dry and wet epochs have persisted for longer periods than observed in the instrumental record\u2014with the probability of both dry and wet periods exceeding a decade at least 10 times more likely prior to 1883 than suggested by the instrumental records. Some reconstructed rainfalls exceeded the instrumental range (i.e., drier dry epochs and wetter wet spells) despite a systematic underestimation of extremes due to a combination of proxy quality and model bias. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the instrumental record does not cover the full range of hydroclimatic variability possible in the MDB.
