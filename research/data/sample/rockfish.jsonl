Metabolites involved in energy metabolism and basic amino acids were significantly increased upon acute exposure to 27\u00b0C (P < 0.05), and no change in metabolite levels occurred in the low water temperature group. However, certain fatty acid levels were elevated after cold stress (P < 0.05), and this effect was not observed in the 27\u00b0C group, suggesting that acute high and low temperature exposures caused different physiological responses. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we analyzed the expression of ubiquitin (ub), hypoxia-inducible factor (hif), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acac). Higher expression levels of ub, hif, and ldh (P < 0.05) were observed in the high water temperature group, but no changes in these expression levels occurred in the low water temperature group.

We investigated population structure among fish sampled from two nearshore reefs (Siletz Reef and Seal Rock) and one offshore site (Stonewall Bank) within a <50\u2010km2 area off the Oregon coast. Fish from the three sample sites exhibited small but statistically significant differences based on genetic variation at >15,000 neutral loci, whether analyzed independently or classified into nearshore and offshore groups. Male and females were readily distinguished using genetic data and 92 outlier loci were associated with sex, potentially indicating differential selection between males and females. Morphometric results indicated that there was significant secondary sexual dimorphism in otolith shape, but further sampling is required to disentangle potential confounding influence of age. This study is the first step toward understanding intraspecific variation within the deacon rockfish and the potential management implications. Since differentiation among the three sample sites was small, we consider the results to be suggestive of a single stock.

As a regulatory protein, Raptor is awfully important for the stability and function of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). However, the studies about how Raptor/mTORC1 participates in and regulates immune response in lower vertebrates are still limited. In this study, we investigated the regulation of immune response by the Raptor/mTORC1 signaling pathway in rockfish Sebastes schlegelii. Sebastes schlegelii Raptor (Ss-Raptor) is a highly conserved protein during the evolution, in both primary and tertiary structure. Ss-Raptor mRNA was widely distributed in various tissues of rockfish and has a relative higher expression in spleen and blood. After infected by Micrococcus luteus or Listonella anguillarum, mRNA expression of Ss-Raptor rapidly increased within 48 h. Once Raptor/mTORC1 signaling was blocked by rapamycin, expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 was severely impaired, suggesting potential regulatory role of Raptor/mTORC1 signaling in the innate immune response of rockfish. In addition, Raptor/mTORC1 pathway participated in lymphocyte activation of rockfish through promoting 4EBP1 and S6 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Raptor/mTORC1 signaling crippled the lymphocyte expansion during primary adaptive immune response, manifesting by the decrease of lymphoid organ weight and lymphocyte numbers. More importantly, inhibition of Raptor/mTORC1 signaling impaired the lymphocyte mediated cytotoxic response, and made the fish more vulnerable to the bacterial infection. Together, our results suggested that Raptor and its tightly regulated mTORC1 signaling acts as modulatory center to regulate both innate and lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immune response during bacterial infection. This research has shed new light on regulatory mechanism of teleost immune response, and provide helpful evidences to understand the evolution of immune system.", "authors": [{"authorId": "152314061", "name": "K.

Our findings indicate that these congeners express different sensitivities to elevated CO2 levels. Copper rockfish (S. caurinus) exhibited changes in behavioral lateralization, reduced critical swimming speed, depressed aerobic scope, changes in metabolic enzyme activity, and increases in the expression of transcription factors and regulatory genes at high pCO2 exposure. Blue rockfish (S. mystinus), in contrast, showed no significant changes in behavior, swimming physiology, or aerobic capacity, but did exhibit significant changes in the expression of muscle structural genes as a function of pCO2, indicating acclimatization potential.

Two of the archaeological sites are located within a marine protected area specifically designed to facilitate the recovery of inshore rockfish populations; two sites are located outside this boundary and remain subject to considerable fishing pressure. Using mitochondrial 16S and control region DNA sequences, we identify at least twelve different rockfish species utilized during the past 2,500 years. Identification of rockfish at closely spaced and contemporaneously occupied sites confirms that a variety of Sebastes species were consistently exploited at each site, with more exposed areas having a higher number of species present. Identification results indicate that four of the twelve species did not occur within the conservation area boundary and, instead, were found in sites where commercial and recreational fishing continues to be permitted.

To determine the necessity of dietary methionine supplementation at the highest inclusion of WM, a diet was prepared to contain 32% WM without methionine supplementation (WM32\u2010AA). Triplicate groups of rockfish juveniles (Mean \u00b1 S.E.; 3.11 \u00b1 0.01 g) were fed one of the experimental diets to apparent satiation twice daily for 8 weeks. Fish growth performance in terms of weight gain and specific growth rate increased with increasing dietary inclusion of WM from 0 to 16% and then tended to decrease with further increase in dietary WM levels to 32%. Protein retention (PR) values followed the same trend as growth rates with the highest values found in fish offered WM16 diet. Although fish fed WM32\u2010AA diet showed significantly lower growth rate and PR values compared to those fed WM16 diet, their performance was still comparable to that of the WM\u2010free control group. Plasma triglyceride level was negatively affected by dietary WM inclusion and the lowest values were observed in the WM32\u2010AA group.

Additionally, some coastal areas periodically experience upwelling of CO2-enriched water with reduced pH. Previous research has demonstrated ocean acidification (OA)-induced changes in behavioural and sensory systems including olfaction, which is due to altered function of neural gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Here, we used a camera-based tracking software system to examine whether OA-dependent changes in GABAA receptors affect anxiety in juvenile Californian rockfish (Sebastes diploproa). Anxiety was estimated using behavioural tests that measure light/dark preference (scototaxis) and proximity to an object. After one week in OA conditions projected for the next century in the California shore (1125 \u00b1 100 \u00b5atm, pH 7.75), anxiety was significantly increased relative to controls (483 \u00b1 40 \u00b5atm CO2, pH 8.1). The GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol, but not the antagonist gabazine, caused a significant increase in anxiety consistent with altered Cl\u2212 flux in OA-exposed fish. OA-exposed fish remained more anxious even after 7 days back in control seawater; however, they resumed their normal behaviour by day 12.

The stomach content analysis revealed that Spotty-bellied Greenlings mainly fed on crabs and fish; Fat Greenlings mainly preyed on fish, crabs, and shrimps; Korean Rockfish primarily consumed fish and shrimps; and Japanese Seaperch mainly fed on fish. Korean Rockfish had the highest dietary breadth index among the four fish species. Dietary composition of the four species did not overlap significantly, as indicated by Schoener's index. Prey category composition varied across fish species and differed between species pairs (except Korean Rockfish and Japanese Seaperch), as suggested by permutational ANOVA tests. The stable isotope analysis suggested that Japanese Seaperch had significantly higher C-13 and N-15 and had a significantly different centroid position, both of which indicated a higher trophic position. The corrected standard ellipse area on the N-15-C-13 (parts per thousand) biplot varied in size among species and significantly overlapped in the three rockfishes, with the largest overlap area observed between Fat Greenlings and Korean Rockfish. The results, in general, suggested that the three rockfish species, especially Korean Rockfish and Fat Greenlings, had similar trophic niches, but they were partitioned by prey resources according to the stomach content composition.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, a measure of oxidative stress, was substantially elevated in the livers and gills of fish given dietary Pb greater than 60 mg/kg.

For most year classes, there was no relationship between the density of YOY and the density of 1 yr olds or the density of adults, and instead habitat variables such as topological complexity and the amount of rocky substrate predicted adult black rockfish abundance.

To test for these effects, underwater visual surveys and collections of young-of-the-year (YOY) copper rockfish recruitment (summer 2015) were compared across adjacent seagrass, kelp forest, and sand habitats within a nearshore seascape on the Central Coast of British Columbia. Recruitment was positively influenced by the structural complexity of seagrass and adjacency to kelp forest sites, however a negative interaction between seagrass complexity and kelp forest adjacency suggests that predation modifies copper rockfish recruitment densities. In addition, using isotopes to determine the basal contributions to rockfish food webs, kelp-derived nutrients were on average 47% \u00b1 0.4 of YOY copper rockfish diets, which was 3x and 67x greater than the contribution of autochthonous seagrass production (seagrass epiphyte and seagrass blades, respectively). YOY copper rockfish diets in seagrass adjacent to sand habitats had the greatest amounts of kelp-derived nutrients and harpacticoid copepods, and concurrently had lower body condition compared to rockfish in the seagrass kelp edges and interior, feeding predominantly on seagrass epiphytes and calanoid copepods. This thesis provides further evidence that temperate seagrasses are nurseries for rockfish and that spatial elements of seascapes, including connectivity via habitat adjacency and variability in habitat structure, alter the recruitment and diets of rockfish in seagrass habitats. These seascape nursery effects are important considerations for marine planning, especially given the global decline of nearshore habitats.", "authors": [{"authorId": "5375828", "name": "Angeleen M.

Total bile acids increased with increases in dietary taurine. Taurocholic acid content was more than 95% of the total conjugated bile acids. This indicates that taurine is the sole amino acid to make conjugated bile acid in Korean rockfish.

Numerous studies have applied comparative approaches to test one of the predictions of the theory: That the rate of mitochondrial mutations is negatively correlated with longevity. Comparative studies face three challenges in detecting correlates of mutation rate: Covariation of mutation rates between species due to ancestry, covariation between life-history traits, and difficulty obtaining accurate estimates of mutation rate. We address these challenges using a novel Poisson regression method to examine the link between mutation rate and lifespan in rockfish (Sebastes). This method has better performance than traditional sister-species comparisons when sister species are too recently diverged to give reliable estimates of mutation rate. Rockfish are an ideal model system: They have long life spans with indeterminate growth and little evidence of senescence, which minimizes the confounding tradeoffs between lifespan and fecundity. We show that lifespan in rockfish is negatively correlated to rate of mitochondrial mutation, but not the rate of nuclear mutation. The life history of rockfish allows us to conclude that this relationship is unlikely to be driven by the tradeoffs between longevity and fecundity, or by the frequency of DNA replications in the germline. Instead, the relationship is compatible with the hypothesis that mutation rates are reduced by selection in long-lived taxa to reduce the chance of mitochondrial damage over its lifespan, consistent with the mitochondrial theory of ageing.", "authors": [{"authorId": "48666838", "name": "X.

Metals concentrations in livers (inorganic Hg, methyl mercury, Se, Ni, Cd, Cu, Zn) and spleens (inorganic Hg and methyl mercury) were determined, as well as their correlations with melano\u2010macrophage aggregate area. Sections of liver tissue were analyzed by laser ablation\u2010inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry to determine how metals were spatially distributed between hepatocytes and macrophage aggregates. The concentration of inorganic Hg in whole tissue was the best predictor of macrophage area in yelloweye livers and spleens.

However, not all metals were accumulated to the same degree, as evidenced by differences in the ratios of metals in macrophages compared with hepatocytes.

Eight hundred and ten juvenile fish averaging 3.22\u00a0g were randomly chosen and distributed into 27 flow-through tanks of 50\u00a0L (30 fish per tank). Nine experimental diets were prepared according to a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 factorial experimental design: three crude protein levels (45%, 50% and 55%)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0three crude lipid levels (11%, 15% and 19%).
