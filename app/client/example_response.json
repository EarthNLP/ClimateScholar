                "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is NASA’s first satellite designed to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) with the precision, resolution, and coverage necessary to quantify regional carbon sources and sinks. OCO-2 launched on 2 July 2014, and during the first 2 years of its operation, a major El Niño occurred: the 2015–2016 El Niño, which was one of the strongest events ever recorded. El Niño and its cold counterpart La Niña (collectively known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation or ENSO) are the dominant modes of tropical climate variability. ENSO originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean but spurs a variety of anomalous weather patterns around the globe. Not surprisingly, it also leaves an imprint on the global carbon cycle. Understanding the magnitude and phasing of the ENSO-CO2 relationship has important implications for improving the predictability of carbon-climate feedbacks. The high-density observations from NASA’s OCO-2 mission, coupled with surface ocean CO2 measurements from NOAA buoys, have provided us with a unique data set to track the atmospheric CO2 concentrations and unravel the timing of the response of the ocean and the terrestrial carbon cycle during the 2015–2016 El Niño. RATIONALE During strong El Niño events, there is an overall increase in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This increase is predominantly due to the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to El Niño–induced changes in weather patterns. But along with the terrestrial component, the tropical Pacific Ocean also plays an important role. Typically, the tropical Pacific Ocean is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to equatorial upwelling that brings CO2-rich water from the interior ocean to the surface. During El Niño, this equatorial upwelling is suppressed in the eastern and the central Pacific Ocean, reducing the supply of CO2 to the surface. If CO2 fluxes were to remain constant elsewhere, this reduction in ocean-to-atmosphere CO2 fluxes should contribute to a slowdown in the growth of atmospheric CO2. This hypothesis cannot be verified, however, without large-scale CO2 observations over the tropical Pacific Ocean. RESULTS OCO-2 observations confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean played an early and important role in the response of atmospheric CO2 concentrations to the 2015–2016 El Niño. By analyzing trends in the time series of atmospheric CO2, we see clear evidence of an initial decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the tropical Pacific Ocean, specifically during the early stages of the El Niño event (March through July 2015). Atmospheric CO2 concentration anomalies suggest a flux reduction of 26 to 54% that is validated by the NOAA Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring CO2 data. Both the OCO-2 and TAO data further show that the reduction in ocean-to-atmosphere fluxes is spatially variable and has strong gradients across the tropical Pacific Ocean. During the later stages of the El Niño (August 2015 and later), the OCO-2 observations register a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We attribute this increase to the response from the terrestrial component of the carbon cycle—a combination of reduction in biospheric uptake of CO2 over pan-tropical regions and an enhancement in biomass burning emissions over Southeast Asia and Indonesia. The net impact of the 2015–2016 El Niño event on the global carbon cycle is an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which would likely be larger if it were not for the reduction in outgassing from the ocean. CONCLUSION The strong El Niño event of 2015–2016 provided us with an opportunity to study how the global carbon cycle responds to a change in the physical climate system. Space-based observations of atmospheric CO2, such as from OCO-2, allow us to observe and monitor the temporal sequence of El Niño–induced changes in CO2 concentrations. Disentangling the timing of the ocean and terrestrial responses is the first step toward interpreting their relative contribution to the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate, and thereby understanding the sensitivity of the carbon cycle to climate forcing on interannual to decadal time scales. NASA’s carbon sleuth tracks the influence of El Niño on atmospheric CO2. The tropical Pacific Ocean, the center of action during an El Niño event, is shown in cross section. Warm ocean surface temperatures are shown in red, cooler waters in blue. The Niño 3.4 region, which scientists use to study the El Niño, is denoted by yellow dashed lines. As a result of OCO-2’s global coverage and 16-day repeat cycle, it flies over the entire region every few days, keeping tabs on the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Spaceborne observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 are used to characterize the response of tropical atmospheric CO2 concentrations to the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016. Although correlations between the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation are well known, the magnitude of the correlation and the timing of the responses of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycle remain poorly constrained in space and time. We used space-based CO2 observations to confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean does play an early and important role in modulating the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during El Niño events—a phenomenon inferred but not previously observed because of insufficient high-density, broad-scale CO2 observations over the tropics.",

                "abstract": "The projected increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) is expected to increase rice yield, but little is known of the effects of [CO2] at low temperature, which is the major constraint to growing rice in cool climates. We grew rice under two levels of [CO2] (ambient and elevated by 200 μmol mol−1) and two nitrogen (N) fertilization regimes in northern Japan in 2003 (cool weather) and 2004 (warm weather) in the field in a free‐air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased grain yield in both years in both N regimes, but the magnitude of the increase differed between years: 6% in 2003 vs. 17% in 2004, with a significant interaction between [CO2] and year. This difference resulted from responses of spikelet number and ripening percentage to elevated [CO2]. Enhancement of dry matter production and N uptake at heading by elevated [CO2] was smaller in 2003 than in 2004, although at maturity there was no difference between years. No significant interaction between N regime and [CO2] was detected in yield and yield components. The results suggest that yield gain due to elevated [CO2] can be reduced by low temperature.",

                "abstract": "The planet Mars hosts an atmosphere that is perhaps the closest in terms of its meteorology and climate to that of the Earth. But Mars differs from Earth in its greater distance from the Sun, its smaller size, its lack of liquid oceans and its thinner atmosphere, composed mainly of CO2. These factors give Mars a rather different climate to that of the Earth. In this article we review various aspects of the martian climate system from a physicist’s viewpoint, focusing on the processes that control the martian environment and comparing these with corresponding processes on Earth. These include the radiative and thermodynamical processes that determine the surface temperature and vertical structure of the atmosphere, the fluid dynamics of its atmospheric motions, and the key cycles of mineral dust and volatile transport. In many ways, the climate of Mars is as complicated and diverse as that of the Earth, with complex nonlinear feedbacks that affect its response to variations in external forcing. Recent work has shown that the martian climate is anything but static, but is almost certainly in a continual state of transient response to slowly varying insolation associated with cyclic variations in its orbit and rotation. We conclude with a discussion of the physical processes underlying these long- term climate variations on Mars, and an overview of some of the most intriguing outstanding problems that should be a focus for future observational and theoretical studies.",

                "abstract": "Understanding the response of forest net ecosys- tem productivity (NEP) to environmental drivers under cli- mate change is highly relevant for predictions of annual for- est carbon (C) flux budgets. Modeling annual forest NEP with soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models (SVATs), however, remains challenging due to unknown delayed re- sponses to weather of the previous year. In this study, we addressed the influence of previous year's weather on the interannual variability of NEP for a subalpine spruce forest in Switzerland. Analysis of long-term (1997-2011) eddy co- variance measurements showed that the Norway spruce for- est Davos Seehornwald was a consistent sink for atmospheric CO2, sequestering 210± 88 g C m 2 yr 1 on average. Previ- ous year's weather strongly affected interannual variability of NEP, increasing the explained variance in linear models to 53 % compared to 20 % without accounting for previous year's weather. Thus, our results highlight the need to con- sider previous year's weather in modeling annual C budgets of forests. Furthermore, soil temperature in the current year's spring played a major role controlling annual NEP, mainly by influencing gross primary productivity early in the year, with spring NEP accounting for 56 % of annual NEP. Conse- quently, we expect an increase in net CO2 uptake with future climate warming, as long as no other resources become lim- iting.",

                "abstract": "Rising atmospheric CO2 has been predicted to reduce litter decomposition as a result of CO2‐induced reductions in litter quality. However, available data have not supported this hypothesis in mesic ecosystems, and no data are available for desert or semi‐arid ecosystems, which account for more than 35% of the Earth's land area. The objective of our study was to explore controls on litter decomposition in the Mojave Desert using elevated CO2 and interannual climate variability as driving environmental factors. In particular, we sought to evaluate the extent to which decomposition is modulated by litter chemistry (C:N) and litter species and tissue composition. Naturally senesced litter was collected from each of nine 25 m diameter experimental plots, with six plots exposed to ambient [CO2] or 367 μL CO2 L−1 and three plots continuously fumigated with elevated [CO2] (550 μL CO2 L−1) using FACE technology beginning in April 1997. All litter collected in 1998 (a wet, or El Niño year; 306 mm precipitation) was pooled as was litter collected in 1999 (a dry year; 94 mm). Samples were allowed to decompose for 4 and 12 months starting in May 2001 in mesh litterbags in the locations from which litter was collected. Decomposition of litter produced under elevated CO2 and ambient CO2 did not differ. Litter produced in the wetter year showed more rapid initial decomposition (over the first 4 months) than that produced in the drier year (27±2% yr−1 or 7.8±0.7 g m−2 yr−1 for 1998 litter; 18±3% yr−1 or 2.2±0.4 g m−2 yr−1 for 1999 litter). C:N ratios of litter produced under elevated CO2 (wet year: 37±0.5; dry year: 42±2.5) were higher than those of litter produced under ambient CO2 (wet year: 34±1.1; dry year: 35±1.4). Litter production in the wet year (amb. CO2: 25.1±1.1 g m−2 yr−1; elev. CO2: 35.0±1.1 g m−2 yr−1) was more than twice as high as that in the dry year (amb. CO2: 11.6±1.7 g m−2, elev. CO2: 13.3±3.4 g m−2), and contained a greater proportion of Lycium pallidum and a lower proportion of Larrea tridentata than litter produced in the dry year. Decomposition, viewed across all treatments, decreased with increasing C:N ratios, decreased with increasing proportions of Larrea tridentata and increased with increasing proportions of Lycium pallidum and Lycium andersonii. Because litter C:N did not vary by litter production year, and CO2 did not alter decomposition or litter species/tissue composition, it is likely that the impact of year‐to‐year variation in precipitation on the proportion of key plant species in the litter may be the most important way in which litter decomposition will be modulated in the Mojave Desert under future rising atmospheric CO2.",

                "abstract": "Here we report on an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) to compare the efficacy of near‐infrared satellite observations of CO2 from a highly elliptical orbit (HEO) and a low Earth orbit (LEO), for constraining Arctic and boreal CO2 sources and sinks. The carbon cycle at these latitudes (~50–90°N) is primarily driven by the boreal forests, but increasing anthropogenic activity and the effects of climate change such as thawing of permafrost throughout this region could also have an important role in the coming years. A HEO enables quasi‐geostationary observations of Earth's northern high latitudes, which are not observed from a geostationary orbit. The orbit and observing characteristics for the HEO mission are based on the Weather, Climate and Air quality (WCA) concept proposed for the Polar Communications and Weather (PCW) mission, while those for the LEO mission are based on the Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). Two WCA instrument configurations were investigated. Adopting the Optimal configuration yielded an observation data set that gave annual Arctic and boreal regional terrestrial biospheric CO2 flux uncertainties an average of 30% lower than those from GOSAT, while a smaller instrument configuration resulted in uncertainties averaging 20% lower than those from GOSAT. For either WCA instrument configuration, much greater reductions in uncertainty occur for spring, summer, and autumn than for winter, with Optimal flux uncertainties for June–August nearly 50% lower than from GOSAT. These findings demonstrate that CO2 observations from HEO offer significant advantages over LEO for constraining CO2 fluxes from the Arctic and boreal regions.",

                "abstract": "Extreme weather events can have strong negative impacts on species survival and community structure when surpassing lethal thresholds. Extreme, short‐lived, winter warming events in the Arctic rapidly melt snow and expose ecosystems to unseasonably warm air (for instance, 2–10 °C for 2–14 days) but upon return to normal winter climate exposes the ecosystem to much colder temperatures due to the loss of insulating snow. Single events have been shown to reduce plant reproduction and increase shoot mortality, but impacts of multiple events are little understood as are the broader impacts on community structure, growth, carbon balance, and nutrient cycling. To address these issues, we simulated week‐long extreme winter warming events – using infrared heating lamps and soil warming cables – for 3 consecutive years in a sub‐Arctic heathland dominated by the dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis‐idaea (both evergreen) and Vaccinium myrtillus (deciduous). During the growing seasons after the second and third winter event, spring bud burst was delayed by up to a week for E. hermaphroditum and V. myrtillus, and berry production reduced by 11–75% and 52–95% for E. hermaphroditum and V. myrtillus, respectively. Greater shoot mortality occurred in E. hermaphroditum (up to 52%), V. vitis‐idaea (51%), and V. myrtillus (80%). Root growth was reduced by more than 25% but soil nutrient availability remained unaffected. Gross primary productivity was reduced by more than 50% in the summer following the third simulation. Overall, the extent of damage was considerable, and critically plant responses were opposite in direction to the increased growth seen in long‐term summer warming simulations and the ‘greening’ seen for some arctic regions. Given the Arctic is warming more in winter than summer, and extreme events are predicted to become more frequent, this generates large uncertainty in our current understanding of arctic ecosystem responses to climate change.",
