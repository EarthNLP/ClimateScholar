# Research Outline:
Use this section to set an outline and guiding vision describing your work. 

### The Problem (What)
- A brief description of the problem we're hoping to solve with our work.

### Why even do this? (Why)
- An overview of why this would matter and why it is worth solving.

### How do current approaches fail or fall short?
- Come up with a list of current or related approaches and why they either won't work or underperform.
- This also acts as a small lit review & can use to set up baselines for comparisons.

### What does our solution look like?
- Map what the solution is expcted to look like. This will likely change over the course of the project.

### When is the problem considered "solved"?
- A general idea of what evaluation metrics will be used and in some cases what is the quantity required for it to be "solved".

### What are potential pitfalls or known unknowns?
- Outline what might cause the project to fail, whether that is incomplete knowledge, known shortcomings of your approach, or areas of high uncertainity. 

### What is the plan?
- Create a list of steps and action items needed to get started working.
- Consider using project management tools like Github's Issues or Project pages to help keep track of work. 

# Documentation
Use this section to get a head start in ensuring your work is reproducible and readers hoping to apply your research can follow along with little hassle. 

### Setup
- Describe how to set up the project. What are the dependencies, any hardware/software requirements, where/how can we download the data used?

### Train / Test
- If you created an ML system, how can we run the training loop on our machine? How do evaluate the model the same way as the paper?
- If this isn't an ML system you can still describe the testing/eval process here so others can recreate your work easily. 

### Usage
- Share example usage code or describe how someone might apply your solution to their own domain.
